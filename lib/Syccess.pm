=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Syccess;

  my $syccess = Syccess->new(
    fields => [
      foo => [ required => 1, length => 4, label => 'PIN Code' ],
      bar => [ required => { message => 'You have 5 seconds to comply.' } ],
      # if no label is given its made out of the name so 'Bar' in this case
      baz => [ length => { min => 2, max => 4 }, label => 'Ramba Zamba' ],
    ],
  );

  my $result = $syccess->validate( foo => 1, bar => 1 );
  if ($result->success) {
    print "Yeah!\n";
  }

  my $failed = $syccess->validate();
  unless ($failed->success) {
    for my $message (@{$failed->errors}) {
      print $message->message."\n";
    }
  }

  my $traitsful_syccess = Syccess->new(
    result_traits => [qw( MyApp::Syccess::ResultRole )],
    error_traits => [qw( MyApp::Syccess::ErrorRole )],

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<Syccess> is a simple validation layer, which allows to check a hash of values
against a validation definition and give back success or allow to see the
error messages of the failure. I<Syccess> is not made for caring about anything
else, so for a higher level library you integrate Syccess and not try to extend
it. I<Syccess> is not made for giving extra attributes to the fields, the
validator should be the key topic here, and it is very easy to make own
validators specific for your environment, see L<Syccess::Validator> and
L<Syccess::ValidatorSimple>, but you should be aware that most requirements
should be covered with L<Syccess::Validator::Code> and
L<Syccess::Validator::Call>, as both allow you to use simple validation methods
you already may have in your model. This way you don't end up making I<Syccess>
specific procedures, that might be harder to maintain.

The complete concept of Syccess is read only, which means, a call to
L</validate> will produce a L<Syccess::Result> which contains the resulting
information, while the I<Syccess> object stays unchanged. A I<Syccess> object
contains a I<Syccess::Field> object for every field of your L</fields>
definition. On this field you have an object for every validator. Be aware that
the validators are given as ArrayRef and you can use the same validator several
times.

B<BEHAVIOUR INFO:> The validators provided by the Syccess core are all
designed to ignore a non existing value, an undefined value or an empty
string. If you want that giving those leads to an error, then you must use the
B<required> validator of L<Syccess::Validator::Required>. If you need to check
against those values, for example you use L<Syccess::Validator::Code> and in
some cases an undefined value is valid and sometimes not, then you must make
a custom validator, see L</custom_validator_namespaces>.

=attr fields

Required ArrayRef containing the definition of the fields for the validation.
It always first the name of the field and then an ArrayRef again with the
validators. Those will be dispatched to instantiation L<Syccess::Field> to
create the B<fields> objects. See more about validators on its attribute at
L<Syccess::Field>. You can provide a validator several times, like several
B<regex> or several B<code> validators.

=attr validator_namespaces

This attribute is the main namespace collection, where Syccess searches for
its validators. Normally you do not set it directly, instead you set
L</custom_validator_namespaces>, else you would remove I<Syccess::Validator>
and the I<SyccessX::Validator>, which are automatically added after the
L</custom_validator_namespaces> by default here.

=attr custom_validator_namespaces

Here you define an ArrayRef of the namespaces that should be used additional
to the default ones. For example, if you add validator B<foo_bar>, then
Syccess would search first with your custom namespace, for example
I<MyApp::Validator::FooBar>, and after that it checks for
I<Syccess::Validator::FooBar> and finally I<SyccessX::Validator::FooBar>.

For making custom validator, you must use the L<Syccess::Validator> role, which
allows to check over all params given. If you just want to make a simple
validator that checks against only the relevant value of the field, then you
can use L<Syccess::ValidatorSimple>.

Please use B<SyccessX::Validator> as namespace if you want to upload a new
general validator to B<CPAN>.

=attr result_class

The class which is used for the result. Default is L<Syccess::Result>.

=attr error_class

The class which is used for errors. Default is L<Syccess::Error>.

=attr field_class

The class which is used for the fields. Default is L<Syccess::Field>.

=attr result_traits

Traits to be added to the L<Syccess::Result> class. See B<with_traits> at
L<MooX::Traits>.

=attr error_traits

Traits to be added to the L<Syccess::Error> class. See B<with_traits> at
L<MooX::Traits>.

=attr field_traits

Traits to be added to the L<Syccess::Field> class. See B<with_traits> at
L<MooX::Traits>.

=attr errors_args

Here you can give custom attributes which are dispatched to the instantiation
of the L</error_class> objects.

=method new_with_traits

See L<MooX::Traits>.

=method field

Get the L<Syccess::Field> for the name given as parameter.

=method fields

Get all L<Syccess::Field> of the Syccess object.

=method validate

This is the main function to produce a L</result_class> object, which will
then hold the result and the errors of the validation process. This function
must be called with a Hash (no HashRef yet supported) of the values to check
for the validation.

=head1 Core Validators

=head2 call

L<Syccess::Validator::Call> - Calling a method on an object for validation

=head2 code

L<Syccess::Validator::Code> - Using a CodeRef to validate

=head2 in

L<Syccess::Validator::In> - Checking if a value is in a given list of values

=head2 is_number

L<Syccess::Validator::IsNumber> - Check if the value is a number

=head2 length

L<Syccess::Validator::Length> - Check for length of the string, if its
specific or min or max values.

=head2 regex

L<Syccess::Validator::Regex> - Check the value against a regex

=head2 required

L<Syccess::Validator::Required> - Value must be provided, and cant be empty

=head1 Label Concept

The system is designed to deliver a validation only, which leaded to the
decision to not include the ability to give fields specific attributes. As
a consequence out of this, the implementation of a label concept (so a visual
representation of the field name in the error message) is done with a special
trick, as seen in the L</SYNOPSIS>, through giving it as just another
validator, it will then be consumed as label for the field instead of the load
of another validator object.

=head1 TODO

One bigger feature planned is adding the ability to stack I<Syccess> objects to
allow cascaded parameters for validation. Currently this is not implemented,
because, if you integrate I<Syccess> in a bigger context, you will want to control
the cascading yourself (in my case L<SyForm> takes the control of this). But I
hope I will find later the time to make this possible.
